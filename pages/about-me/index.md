My Name is Daniel Hindbo Jensen(dhjensen). I'm autistic and have ADHD.  
I life in Copenhagen(Denmark) with my wife Arlene.

I'm a tech enthusiast. I especially enjoy figuring out how computer systems work.  
For this site I choose Nikola as the static site generator because its written in Python and allows me to write the content in Markdown.

Gaming is another one of my passions. I mainly play [Albion Online](https://albiononline.com/) right now. I used to play games like [OpenTTD](https://openttd.org/), [World of Tanks](https://worldoftanks.eu/) and [Crusader Kings III](https://www.crusaderkings.com/).
